$C(T_i)$
\[
C(T_i) = L_i \cdot n_i
\]
where:
\\$C(T_i)$ - Total isolated communication cost of task $T_i$ 
\\$L_i$ - Communication load of one hop of task $T_i$
\\$n_i$ - Number of hops from task $T_i$ to destination

\[
C(T_i) = L_i \cdot n_i + \sum_{k=1}^{j} L_j \cdot n_j
\]
\\where:
\\$C(T_i)$ - Total communication cost of task $T_i$ 
\\$L_i$ - Communication load of one hop of task $T_i$
\\$n_i$ - Number of hops from task $T_i$ to destination
\\$L_j$ - Communication load of one hop of task $T_j$
\\$n_j$ - Number of common hops for task $T_j$ and $T_i$
